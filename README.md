“Hello, tiny friends! Today's a magical day! We're off on a color adventure with Cuddles the Puppy and Mrs. Jones. Are you ready to discover a rainbow of fun? Let's jump into our story!"

"Good morning, Cuddles! Our enchanted room is bursting with colors! Can you find the red surprise?"

"Zoom! That's red! Like a shiny apple in the sun! Let's cheer 'red' with Cuddles!"

"What about blue, Cuddles? What in our bubble land is blue?"

"Splash! That's blue! Like the sky above, so vast and true! Sing 'blue' with Cuddles."

“And what shines yellow, Cuddles? Something as happy as a daisy's face!"

"Twinkle! That's yellow! Like a cozy light on a dark night! Say 'yellow' with Cuddles!"

"Now, what's this lovely color? Can you find something green, Cuddles?"

"Rustle! That's green! Like the leaves playing in the park! Whisper 'green' with Cuddles."

"And look there, Cuddles! What color is that gentle glow?"

"Shimmer! That's pink! Like the petals of a rose in the morning dew! Giggle 'pink' with Cuddles."

"You're doing great, Cuddles! And so are you, little stars! You've filled our day with color and light!"


"Remember, every day is a story, and you're the hero! Red, blue, yellow, green, and pink. Keep dreaming and keep shining.”


"Say 'see you soon' to our color parade! Join us next time for more fun with Cuddles and Mrs. Jones. Stay bright
